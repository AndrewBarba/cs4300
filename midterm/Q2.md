Question 2
==========

Note: The question specifies to do a **single** iteration. I am assuming that means Steps 1, 2, 3 and then a single round of i-v. That seems too easy but I can't think of any other way to interpret the instructions. A single iteration through i-v can technically only draw a single edge.
