Question 5
==========

Straight ahead animation describes drawing an animation sequence in order from the very first frame, to the second, to the third, fouth, etc. until you finally draw the last frame. Pose to pose describes drawing the first frame and then last frame, and then the middle frame. You are essentially doing a binary sequence to work your back in between any two poses. Pose to pose has a great advantage over straight ahead when you know the beginning and ending positions of a animation. Straight ahead could easily lead to inconsistencies in the objects size or even end up in the wrong location. Pose to pose saves the artist time because you can catch inconsistencies much earlier in the process.
