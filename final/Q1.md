Question 1
==========

#### Bézier curve
A curve that tangentially connects 3 or more points. At each point in a bezier curve, you can tweak it's "handles" which specify how the tangential edge to that point should bend.

#### Chromaticity
A description of how "pure" a color is in terms of visibility. Chromaticity can help determine if certain colors will be visible on a specific electronic device.  

#### Lambert’s Cosine Law
Describes a surface when viewed from angle x, looks identical (in terms of luminous intensity) when viewed at angle cos(x). A surface which obeys this law will theoretically looks the same when viewed at any angle, regardless of the angle of the light source.

#### Affine Transformation
A transformation to an object that maintains angles between lines. Some examples are scaling an image, translating an image or rotating an image.

#### Convolution
A way to map function x onto function y. A convolution is not a final result but a way to map another function onto an input to obtain a result. A good example of this is a blurring function which is a convolution between the function and a given image.
