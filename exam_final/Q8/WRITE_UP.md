For my visualization I wrote code which can calculate retention based on any data set, as long as you provide a function that can calculate and initial set of unique values for a given time period and then another function which can also provide a unique set of values for a given date range. Specifically I wanted to look at work similarity throughout the set of tweets and see if the context of the of the tweets was changing over time.

In my visualization you can see the first two columns represent the number of unique words tweeted out on a given date. Then, all subsequent columns looks to show the percentage of words used 1 day later, 2 days later, 3 days etc. that were similar to the initial data set.

In the excel file I computed the average similarity for column. The averages that show that an any given date after the original date, you can expect about 25% of the tweets to be similar in nature. Interestingly, the words that are most similar are actually profanity, mailny things like "bitch" and other words of that nature.
