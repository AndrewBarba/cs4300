#### 1. Straight Ahead Action
The legs of the table are animated using Straight Ahead Action. Every frame the legs are animated one tick further based on the rotational velocity of the leg. The animation is done in sequence, on every tick.

#### 2. Slow In and Slow Out
The pulsing ring around the "current time" indicator is animated use an ease-in-out curve. It is modeled off of a sin wave which provides a a nice slow-in, slow-out curve that feels realistic.

#### 3. Arc
The legs of the table are animated around a arc and the speed at which they animate is based on a sin wave. This provides realistic movement of the legs, as if they were effected by gravity.

#### 4. Secondary Action
As the table's legs are animated in arc fashion, the table is also being translated across the screen. This translation of the table is it's secondary action.

#### 5. Exaggeration
As the "current time" indicator move across the background, there is an animating ring that expands and contracts and follows the indicator. This ring exaggerates the fact that we are moving through time.

#### 6. Timing
Our animating table times it's movements with the speed of the song playing in the background. As the beat gets faster, the table begins to swing it's legs at a faster pace. This timing provides a nice effect and adds realism to the scene.

#### 7. Anticipation
Because our figure is an inanimate it is difficult to find anticipation it's movement, however, the song playing in the baclground allows to anticipate the speed of movement based on how the beat of the song. This is a powerful concept in gaming where a good score can add to the anticipation and intensity of the scene.

#### 8. Staging
The table in the scene sets the stage for the entire animation. The table is clearly the center piece, and sits above the background and even the animating progress bar. Because of the position of the table in the z-index, the stage is clear that the audience should be focusing on the table.
