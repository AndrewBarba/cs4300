Question 2
==========

Collision detection is an important concept in game development where often times you want objects in your system to simulate real physical movement. There a many ways to determine whether 2 objects collide in a 2D space, some are going to be more exact and others are going to be less computation intensive. Below I am going to outline an algorithm that opts for speed and loses some preciseness.

Bounding Box Algorithm:

0. Our coordinate system starts with (0, 0) in the top left of the bounded space.
1. Bound your objects with parallel top and bottom edges
2. Bound your objects with parallel left and right edges.
3. Select 2 objects to compare.
4. Store `bottom_ok` as obj1.bottom < obj2.top
5. Store `top_ok` as obj1.top > obj2.bottom
6. Store `left_ok` as obj1.left > obj2.right
7. Store `right_ok` as obj1.right < obj2.left
8. Return NOT (bottom_ok OR top_ok OR left_ok OR right_ok)

This algorithm is extremely fast and easy to compute with lots of objects on screen. It essentially O(1) complexity for any 2 objects. With that said, it loses precision by bounding all objects to a 2D rectangle. This type of algorithm would be suitable for something like Mario where objects are generally pretty rectangular. It would not be suitable for something like Halo where precise collision detection is key to the outcome of a players health on the battle field.
